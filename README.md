## Section 1: Selling CI/CD to your Team/Organization
|CRITERIA|MEETS SPECIFICATIONS|Files|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Explain the fundamentals and benefits of CI/CD to achieve, build, and deploy automation for cloud-based software products.|The CI/CD benefits proposal contains essential benefits of CI/CD, and describes the business context that will benefit from the automation tools. Explanation should include benefits that translate to revenue and cost for the business.|[presentation.pdf](./presentation.pdf)|
