In the previous topic we installed Prometheus and now is ready to receive metrics.   
The next step is to launch a second AWS EC2 instance, install Prometheus Node Exporter in it and finally, configure Prometheus to collect its metrics.

## Prometheus Node Exporter  
There are [many exporters](https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exporters) and integrations available for Prometheus.   
As mentioned above, in this example we are going to install Prometheus Node Exporter in an AWS EC2 instance.

 >“Prometheus exporter for hardware and OS metrics exposed by *NIX kernels, written in Go with pluggable metric collectors.”

**Setup an EC2 Machine**   
The instructions are similar to [the steps we followed to create a Prometheus EC2 instance](./prometheus-on-aws-ec2-part1.md) with some light differences.

One of these differences is that we don’t need to create a new Key Pair since we already created one for Prometheus, as long we have this key safely stored we can choose it from the drop down.

The second difference is that we also don’t need to create a Security Group since we already created one with all the inbound and outbound rules defined for Prometheus and for the Node Exporter.

**Installation**
Now we should have two AWS EC2 instances created, one Security group and one ssh key for both machines. In your case it will be different but I got the following:

|Machine	|Public DNS	|Port|
|:----|:----|:----|
|prometheus-server	|ec2-3-17-28.53.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com	|9090|
|prometheus-node-exporter	|ec2-13-58-127-241.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com	|9100|

We need to start a session in the new virtual machine.

```console
ssh -i prometheus.pem ubuntu@ec2-13-58-127-241.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com
```

Now let’s create a user for Prometheus Node Exporter
```bash
sudo useradd --no-create-home node_exporter
```

We are ready to install Node Exporter binaries.

```bash
wget https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter/releases/download/v1.0.1/node_exporter-1.0.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz
tar xzf node_exporter-1.0.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz
sudo cp node_exporter-1.0.1.linux-amd64/node_exporter /usr/local/bin/node_exporter
rm -rf node_exporter-1.0.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz node_exporter-1.0.1.linux-amd64
```

Configure a service. Create `/etc/systemd/system/node-exporter.service` if it doesn’t exist.
```service
[Unit]
Description=Prometheus Node Exporter Service
After=network.target

[Service]
User=node_exporter
Group=node_exporter
Type=simple
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/node_exporter

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Configure systemd.

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable node-exporter
sudo systemctl start node-exporter
sudo systemctl status node-exporter
```

**Configure Prometheus Server**   
Now we need to go back to the first AWS EC2 instance where we installed Prometheus and change its configuration to start receiving metrics from the Node Exporter we just installed and configured.

Start a session in the Prometheus host virtual machine.

```console
ssh -i prometheus.pem ubuntu@ec2-3-17-28.53.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com
```
Edit `/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml` file.

```yml
global:
  scrape_interval: 15s
  external_labels:
    monitor: 'prometheus'

scrape_configs:

  - job_name: 'node_exporter'

    static_configs:

      - targets: ['ec2-13-58-127-241.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9100']
      
```

Remember that `ec2-13-58-127-241.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com` is the DNS value I got from my configuration and yours should be something different.

Restart Prometheus service.

```bash
sudo systemctl restart prometheus
```

**Try It Out**
Now in your browser navigate to `http://ec2-3-17-28.53.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9090/targets` .   
Remember to change the url accordingly to your Prometheus AWS EC2 instance details and you should see something similar to this:
